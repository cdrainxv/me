Something I've have putting off for the longest time is setting up a personal site with my own domain, but as you can see by the url, I have finally done it. For the life of me I don't know why I had not set one up earlier. Was it my reluctance to have an internet presence? Did I think I would make a fool of myself online and my future self? Regardless of my previous thoughts, I want a location to log, present, and teach myself -- and hopefully others as well. I've already seen the value in writing a tutorial about a problem you solved, you forget the problem, search for a solution, and you come upon your own. There's nothing better than that! 

I found that registering a domain on namecheap wasn't too difficult, but actually creating a site on the domain was troublesome. I started off with one of the gatsbyjs starter templates which was already setup to support a blog and a netlify cms. Linking my domain to the netlify hosted site was fairly easy due to their very readable documentation. Where I ran into trouble was figuring out how to add a new collection to the gatsby starter template to support projects as I intended to make the site a blog/projects combo, i.e a portfolio. I finally got around to solving this issue with constant searches on gatsby issue pages, stackoverflow, and reviewing how the template was setup. 

Learning a new thing is always exciting, but sharing it with others multiplies that excitement, therefore I hope to either publish a post on my steps to adding a new collection or a video tutorial.
