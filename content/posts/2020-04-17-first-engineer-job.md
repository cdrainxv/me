  The Node development pace is quite quick, therefore at any moment in time we
  might have different projects in development which we need to test on multiple
  versions of node or the codebase could rely on a specific node version. These
  and other scenarios necessitate the need for having a version manager to
  effortlessly switch between multiple node versions.

# Necessary Preamble

Sigh.... It has almost been a full year since I made a post on this site.
About two months ago (February), I had to re-up on this domain name to keep it
alive or else cut ties with it. I ultimately ended up with giving it another
year, hoping against hope that I would subscribe to updating this blog. I can
attest to how difficult it is to write posts. Even through this span of a year,
I had countless opportunities to spew tidbits of exciting news or experiences I
had, but the fire was always choked off due to either lethargy or as the longer
the duration between posts built up, an insurmountable dread on how to condense
such topics within bite-size articles.

This line of thinking is very limiting and not conducive to writing posts to
simply be progress markers. Tutorials, projects, etc should only be additional
waypoints on this journey.

# I GOT A JOB!

I got a job (and still jobbing at it!) somewhere in June of 2019 at
[MatterProductStudio](matterproductstudio.com). The interview process was very
simple - suspiciously so even, but I did not care. I was brought on along to
help with a react-native app that had a rails api. It was very thrilling work,
not only the company was fully-remote, but because of the sheer size of the project and the amount of people working on it from design to development.
