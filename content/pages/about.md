I am Charles Drani.

I am different things to different people, but I am a software developer to all. I fear not knowing enough, but the little that I do know I impart to others to lessen their fears. I am an eager and earnest learner with a rigid learning path, but I welcome any diversions based one new interests or just simple-proof-of-concepts that appear in my free thoughts.

What I love the most is removing things from my "Impossible Ideas" list and adding them to a "If You Feel Up To It" list. The more knowledge gained and applied adds more to the "Impossible Ideas" list, but it increases the confidence required to undertake some of the ideas on the other list. Each project tackled imbues me with a confidence multiplier, making each new project easier to dive into headfirst.

As I consider myself a part of the OSS community, I ultimately want to fully inculcate myself in the culture, namely by creating, contributing, teaching, and advocating for all things open sourced. A strong desire of mine is to start attending developer conferences and at some point give talks at them.

This is a small sample of who I am, who I want to be, and who I am going to be. I will update this as I either reach these goals and surpass them, or I deviate from them in newer avenues, such as writing a book, which is one of my aspirations.

Charles Drani
